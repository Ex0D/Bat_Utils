# Bat_Utils

This repo strore all the .bat files that are useful to me

## Tips

* Generally the syntax of the commands are : (command) [file] {output file}.
* The .exe files can be put in the C:\Windows\System32 folder to be executed globally (the final command will be executed in the folder where you are via the command prompt)
